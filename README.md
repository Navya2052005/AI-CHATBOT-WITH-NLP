An AI Chatbot with Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an intelligent system designed to simulate human-like conversations by understanding, processing, and responding to user input in natural language. Unlike traditional rule-based chatbots that follow predefined scripts, AI chatbots use NLP techniques to interpret the meaning and context behind words, detect user intent, and extract relevant entities (such as names, dates, or locations).

NLP enables chatbots to comprehend different ways of asking the same question, handle spelling or grammar variations, and generate human-like responses. These chatbots are typically powered by machine learning and deep learning models (like BERT, GPT, or RNNs) and can continuously improve through user interactions.

They are widely used in domains such as customer support, e-commerce, healthcare, banking, and education to provide instant assistance, automate repetitive tasks, and enhance user experience.

In short, an AI chatbot with NLP acts as a virtual assistant that bridges the gap between humans and machines, making interactions more natural, efficient, and scalab.
